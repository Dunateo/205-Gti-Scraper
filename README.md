Leboncoin 205 Gti Peugeot scrapper


Hello,
I'm a big fan of the 205 Gti Peugeot unfortunately the value is going up and these Gti cars which at the time was an affordable way to have a fun and dynamic car is becoming a collector's car that doesn't drive much. That's why I wanted to make a scraper allowing to easily retrieve all the ads and sort them!
